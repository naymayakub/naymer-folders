	</h1>
	<h2>Evaluate the treatment and role of women </h2>
		<div clas="one">
			<ol>
				<li>Women were to take care of the family especially the husband and small babies: Baaba look after Effia and Fiifi.</li>
				<li>They were treated as a very low people of the society that they cannot even allow to raise their voice to the men.For instance Effia was looked at very badly after trying to ask Abaaku the governor a question concerning his reign.</li>
				<li>Women were captured as -slaves and mistreated. For example Esi was captured as a slave and raped by the white people then left as if nothing had happened.</li>
				<li>Girls were not given the freedom of choosing the husband of their dream. They were just allowed to marry the,man their parents appoint for them: Effia’s dream husband was Abaaku but she was made to marry a white man: James</li>.
				<li>Women were to make sure that they bare children so that other people don’t talk bad about them and that they are cursed by God:Effia tool some roots and kept them under her bed with his husband since it is believed that the roots helps women to get pregnancy.</li>
				<li>When girls has attained some certain age, they were to work as maids for masters: for instance worked for Baaba as a maid.</li>	
				<li>Women loved to gossip on their husband when they were sited together for example Effia and the other black women who are married by the white men.</li>

	<ol>
		<li>Girls are given freedom of choosing the husband which they want. They are no limitations for that.</li>
		<li>Slavery is no more hence no capturing of women and mistreated of them.</li>
		<li>Very few people look down on women who cannot give birth. It is rarely considered as a curse</li>.
		<li>Women are given as much rights as that of men in terms of professions. They can both work in offices and hire others whether women or men.</li>
		<li>Women have less time to gossip about their husbands since they got dome other businesses to work on them.</li>
		<li>Nowadays, though women are to take care of the family, but the husbands contribute so much in the taking care of the family.</li>	
		<li>>A woman can raise her voice as much as she wants. There is no limitation in that as long as she is telling the truth.</li>
